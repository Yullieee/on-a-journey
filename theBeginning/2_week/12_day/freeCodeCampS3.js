/*

Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).

let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers);
shortHand.test(numbers);
longHand.test(varNames);
shortHand.test(varNames);
All four of these test calls would return true.

These shortcut character classes are also known as shorthand character classes.

Use the shorthand character class \w to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

*/

You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";

numbers.match(shortHand);

You've learned shortcuts for common string patterns like alphanumerics. Another common pattern is looking for just digits or numbers.

The shortcut to look for digit characters is \d, with a lowercase d. This is equal to the character class [0-9], which looks for a single character of any number between zero and nine.

Use the shorthand character class \d to count how many digits are in movie titles. Written out numbers ("six" instead of 6) do not count.

The last challenge showed how to search for digits using the shortcut \d with a lowercase d. You can also search for non-digits using a similar shortcut that uses an uppercase D instead.

The shortcut to look for non-digit characters is \D. This is equal to the character class [^0-9], which looks for a single character that is not a number between zero and nine.

Use the shorthand character class for non-digits \D to count how many non-digits are in movie titles.

Usernames are used everywhere on the internet. They are what give users a unique identity on their favorite sites.

You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

Change the regex userCheck to fit the constraints listed above.

*/

let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i; 
let result4 = userCheck.test(username);

/*

^ - start of input
[a-z] - first character is a letter
[a-z]+ - following characters are letters
\d*$ - input ends with 0 or more digits
| - or
^[a-z] - first character is a letter
\d\d+ - following characters are 2 or more digits
$ - end of input

The challenges so far have covered matching letters of the alphabet and numbers. You can also match the whitespace or spaces between letters.

You can search for whitespace using \s, which is a lowercase s. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it as similar to the character class [ \r\t\f\n\v].

let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let spaceRegex = /\s/g;
whiteSpace.match(spaceRegex);
This match call would return [" ", " "].

Change the regex countWhiteSpace to look for multiple whitespace characters in a string.

*/

let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g;
let result5 = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);

/*

You learned about searching for whitespace using \s, with a lowercase s. You can also search for everything except whitespace.

Search for non-whitespace using \S, which is an uppercase s. This pattern will not match whitespace, carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it being similar to the character class [^ \r\t\f\n\v].

let whiteSpace = "Whitespace. Whitespace everywhere!"
let nonSpaceRegex = /\S/g;
whiteSpace.match(nonSpaceRegex).length;
The value returned by the .length method would be 32.

Change the regex countNonWhiteSpace to look for multiple non-whitespace characters in a string.

/*

Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string ah, your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.

Change the regex ohRegex to match the entire phrase Oh no only when it has 3 to 6 letter h's.

*/

let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6} no/;
let result7 = ohRegex.test(ohStr);

/*

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want to specify the lower number of patterns with no upper limit.

To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

For example, to match only the string hah with the letter a appearing at least 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3,}h/.

let A4 = "haaaah";
let A2 = "haah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleA = /ha{3,}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);
multipleA.test(A100);
In order, the three test calls would return true, false, and true.

Change the regex haRegex to match the word Hazzah only when it has four or more letter z's.

*/

let haStr = "Hazzzzah";
let haRegex = /Haz{4,}ah/;
let result8 = haRegex.test(haStr);

/*

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers using curly brackets. Sometimes you only want a specific number of matches.

To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

For example, to match only the word hah with the letter a 3 times, your regex would be /ha{3}h/.

let A4 = "haaaah";
let A3 = "haaah";
let A100 = "h" + "a".repeat(100) + "h";
let multipleHA = /ha{3}h/;
multipleHA.test(A4);
multipleHA.test(A3);
multipleHA.test(A100);
In order, the three test calls would return false, true, and false.

Change the regex timRegex to match the word Timber only when it has four letter m's.

let timRegex = /Tim{4}ber/;
let result9 = timRegex.test(timStr);

Sometimes the patterns you want to search for may have parts of it that may or may not exist. However, it may be important to check for them nonetheless.

You can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark, ?. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.

For example, there are slight differences in American and British English and you can use the question mark to match both spellings.

let american = "color";
let british = "colour";
let rainbowRegex= /colou?r/;
rainbowRegex.test(american);
rainbowRegex.test(british);
Both uses of the test method would return true.

Change the regex favRegex to match both the American English (favorite) and the British English (favourite) version of the word.
