/*

In this kata, your task is to create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (strings with only 1s and 0s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 3.

Take into account that:

An empty string might be evaluated to true (it's not going to be tested, so you don't need to worry about it - unless you want)
The input should consist only of binary digits - no spaces, other digits, alphanumeric characters, etc.
There might be leading 0s.
Examples (Javascript)
multipleof3Regex.test('000') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('001') should be false
multipleof3Regex.test('011') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test('110') should be true
multipleof3Regex.test(' abc ') should be false
You can check more in the example test cases

const multipleOf3Regex = /^(1(01*0)*1|0)+$/;

//a binary is a multiple of 3 if its odd indexed bits minus its even indexed bits is a multiple of 3
